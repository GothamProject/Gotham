Gotham
======

A Java Go game with [ancient rules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_Go) integration, [SGF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_Game_Format) support and [AI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negamax) mechanics

#Usage
- To play Go in a graphical interface, launch run/gui/GraphicalGo.java
- To play Go in command line, launch run/console/RunConsole.java

#Disclaimer
Project developed during a university course focusing on Java core concepts and Project management.
It can be buggy if playing against a computer on Hard difficulty. The MinMax algorithm also seems to be quite slow.
